# Upgrade wishlist

## Things that bug me
- Can't press TAB to accept suggestions in vim
- yanking should also copy into system clipboard

## Things that maybe should go
- Discord integration plugin is fun but not necessary

## New functionality
- Tmux can be streamlined, I do `new session - navigate - open vim in pane` often
  - Perhaps [https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) would be fun to play with
- Maybe some cool refactoring tools for nvim

## Stuff to try
- Run the install script in a vm to make sure I can trust it
- Upgrade the install script to also install nvim, fzf, etc automatically
