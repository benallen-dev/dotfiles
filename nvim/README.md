# nvim-config

If I'm going to Vim, I'm going to do it right and customise that bad boy!

Based on [ThePrimagen's nvim config](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) and [the accompanying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

### Prerequisites

Prerequisite: install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

Also, you'll need to install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
